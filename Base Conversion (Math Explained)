/* A Mathematical description on How base conversion algorithm works.

Given an integer N, To find the last digit of N in base m we can do N (mod m),

recall, N= mq+r, for some q,r in Z

In base 10, dividing by 10 moves a place value to the left,

similarly dividing by m moves a place value to left in base m

To obtain the second digit from the left in base m, we take the q/m (mod m)

continue this process iteratively until quotient becomes zero.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){

int r,n,base,convert=0;;

printf("Enter your number to convert: \n");
scanf("%d",&base);

printf("Enter your base \n");
scanf("%d",&n);

while (n!=0) {
    r = n % base;
    convert = convert + (r * 10);
    n=n/base;
}

printf("The converted number is %d",convert);

return 0;
}
