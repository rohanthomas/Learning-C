/* A Mathematical description on How base conversion algorithm works.

Given an integer N, To find the last digit of N in base m we can do N (mod m),

recall, N= mq+r, for some q,r in Z

In base 10, dividing by 10 moves a place value to the left,

similarly dividing by m moves a place value to left in base m

To obtain the second digit from the left in base m, we take the q/m (mod m)

continue this process iteratively until quotient becomes zero.
